* Prerequisites
** Vagrant
Install [[https://www.virtualbox.org/][Virtualbox]] and [[https://www.vagrantup.com/][Vagrant]] for the easiest path to installation.


* Installation steps
** With Vagrant
Clone the repository, enter the directory, and type =vagrant up= to
create and start the application inside a virtual machine.

Then go to =localhost:3001= in your browser. Port forwarding is taken
care of by vagrant, so you can access the running instance of the
application in the virtual machine from your host's browser.
